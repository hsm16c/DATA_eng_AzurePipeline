# **Azure Data Architecture with Medallion Design**

## **Overview**
This project implements a data architecture on **Microsoft Azure** using the **Medallion design pattern** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to process and analyze data from **on-premises SQL databases**.  
It leverages Azure services for data **ingestion**, **transformation**, **analytics**, and **visualization**, with a strong focus on **security and governance**.

---

## **Architecture Diagram**

The architecture includes the following components and data flow:

### **Components**
- **On-Prem SQL Database**: Source data.
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**: Extracts data from on-premises SQL and ingests it into Azure.
- **Azure Data Lake Storage**:
  - **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw, unprocessed data.
  - **Silver Layer**: Contains cleaned and standardized data.
  - **Gold Layer**: Curated and aggregated data, ready for analytics.
- **Azure Databricks**: Processes and transforms data across the three layers.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Enables advanced analytics and querying.
- **Power BI**: Visualizes the final data for business users.

### **Security & Governance**
- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**: Identity and access control.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Secure storage for credentials and keys.

---

## **Data Flow**

1. **Extraction**: Data is extracted from the on-premises SQL database via Azure Data Factory.
2. **Bronze Layer**: Raw data is ingested into the Bronze layer of Azure Data Lake.
3. **Silver Layer**: Azure Databricks transforms and cleans the data into a standardized format.
4. **Gold Layer**: Further enrichment and aggregation are done, and the final curated data is stored.
5. **Analytics**: Azure Synapse Analytics runs queries on the Gold layer.
6. **Visualization**: Power BI connects to Synapse to present business insights.
7. **Security**: AAD and Key Vault secure the entire pipeline.

---

## **Prerequisites**

To implement this architecture, the following are required:

- An **Azure subscription** with access to:
  - Azure Data Factory
  - Azure Data Lake Storage
  - Azure Databricks
  - Azure Synapse Analytics
  - Power BI
  - Azure Active Directory
  - Azure Key Vault
- **On-premises SQL database** with network connectivity to Azure (e.g., via **VPN** or **ExpressRoute**).

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Configure Azure Data Factory**
- Create a pipeline to extract data from the on-premises SQL database.
- Ingest data into the **Bronze layer** of Azure Data Lake.

### 2. **Set Up Azure Data Lake Storage**
- Create storage containers for:
  - **bronze/**
  - **silver/**
  - **gold/**
- Apply access control via Azure Active Directory.

### 3. **Configure Azure Databricks**
- Set up a workspace and clusters.
- Develop Spark jobs to:
  - Move data from Bronze → Silver.
  - Move data from Silver → Gold.

### 4. **Set Up Azure Synapse Analytics**
- Create a Synapse workspace.
- Link to the **Gold layer** in Azure Data Lake.
- Enable SQL queries and integration with BI tools.

### 5. **Integrate Power BI**
- Connect Power BI to Synapse.
- Design interactive dashboards and reports.

### 6. **Security & Governance**
- Use **Azure Active Directory** for role-based access control.
- Store all secrets and credentials in **Azure Key Vault**.

---

## **Usage**

- Trigger the **ADF pipeline** to ingest raw data into the Bronze layer.
- Run **Databricks jobs** to process data through Silver and Gold layers.
- Use **Azure Synapse Analytics** to query Gold layer data.
- Build and explore dashboards in **Power BI**.

---

## **Security Considerations**

- Use **Azure AD** to implement **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control).
- Store sensitive information in **Azure Key Vault**.
- Enable **encryption at rest** and **encryption in transit** for all services.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

- Implement **real-time data ingestion** using:
  - Azure Event Hubs  
  - Azure Stream Analytics  
- Add **monitoring and alerts** using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.
- Introduce **machine learning** using Azure Machine Learning for predictive analytics and anomaly detection.
